* Get lights server working for ratiroan. This is used by the executor
(and could be used by the telescope).

* Implement prolog/epilog in the instruments.

* Timings of ratiroan requests. More generally, make the log messages
uniform.

* Factor code from the telescope servers into telescope.tcl.

* Move the finder code in telescope.tcl into guider.tcl.

* Switch dome-fans for ratiroan.

* Detab and remove trailing spaces.

* Version at the start of each line in the various sensor files used for
plots.

* Plots for ddotioan and coatlioan.

* Add dome RH for ratioan.

* Mount /data1 and /data2 in the C2/C3 servers when they start.

* Adopt one uniform means of selecting telescope-dependent packages. For
example, the telescopeX and executorX packages do this differently.

* For ratiroan, opentocool should move the dome to the east. Open should
occur in time to take flats at sunset.

* Interrupt the executor to close immediately even if opening?
